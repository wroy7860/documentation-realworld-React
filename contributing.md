### Interested in creating Conduit for your framework?

To create an official implementation of Conduit, check out our Github issues and see if anyone else has requested and/or is already working on your framework. If not, feel free to open an issue and start working on one!

Occasionally we are able to provide funding grants (from Thinkster) to have app implementations built. Check and see if any issues mention funding grants or shoot a note to hello@thinkster.io for more info.

Also, we're more than happy to link to unofficial Conduit creations/forks in our README. Simply make a pull request!
