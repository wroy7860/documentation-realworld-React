# API

> This project provides you a public hosted API to test your frontend implementations.

Point your API requests to `https://conduit.productionready.io/api` and you're good to go!

## API Usage

The usage of the API is free and non-limited by any kind of key.


## API Limitations

The public APi is currently hosted on a free plan project on Heroku.  
If the hosted API receives no traffic in a 30-minute period, it will sleep. In such a situation, there will be a additional delay on the first request.

:::info
To provide everyone a **safe** and **healthy** experience, the following limitations have been introduced in 2021
:::

The visibility of user content is limited :
- logged out users see only content created by demo accounts
- logged in users see only their content and the content created by demo accounts

Non demo Articles, Tags, and Comments are deleted on Sundays to avoid additional costs.
