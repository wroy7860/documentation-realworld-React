# Special Thanks

RealWorld wouldn't be possible without the help of the open source community reviewing codebases, creating new app implementations, and many other tasks that help push this project forward. We especially appreciate the OSS leaders who have helped contribute to RealWorld:

- **Dan Abramov** (creator of Redux) for  helping [spark the initial idea](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/692009757775896577), [getting the Redux community involved](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1353), as well as graciously taking the time to provide feedback on the Redux codebase
- **Max Lynch** (creator of Ionic) for taking the time to provide guidance in the early days of this project
- **Addy Osmani** (creator of TodoMVC) for helping [spark the initial idea](https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/762828483433144320) and his amazing work with TodoMVC
- **TodoMVC** ([team & contributors](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc#team)) for their exemplary & successful work; their project & org has been an invaluable analogy for us as we've built out RealWorld
- **James Brewer** (docs contributor to Django) for countless brainstorming sessions, helping name this project, and creating the Django codebase + tutorial
